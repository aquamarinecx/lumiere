# Contributing to Lumiere

Thanks for expressing your interest in contributing to Lumiere! We encourage you to take a look at this document before
making a contribution to ensure that your (and our) experience can be beneficial. While these are mostly guidelines and
not hard-coded rules, we hope that you will be able to abide by these guidelines.

## Developing with the source code

**Please create a branch** (of appropriate naming) **if you intend to contribute significantly** (for example, adding a
feature or resolving a bug). Otherwise, contributing to the `main` branch for minor contributions (for example, spelling
errors) are alright as well.

## Creating issues and pull requests

If you notice a bug that should be fixed, would like to ask a question about the source code, or have other queries of
relevance to the project (i.e., Lumiere), you may create an issue. If you have played around with the code and would
like to contribute directly to it, please feel free to create a pull request as well.

Please try to take note of the following:

- Please try to be as detailed as possible — if you noticed a bug, please try to take screenshots if the bugs are visual. Otherwise, please try to be as detailed in explaining your concern as well.
- Please try to format your Issue properly — by using Markdown features like headings, text emphases, and images, you'll be able to help us understand your issue or pull request better.

We don't intend in creating an issue or pull request template just yet since different contexts may
require a different format. However, please try your best to make sure that your Issue is still somewhat formatted and
structured.
